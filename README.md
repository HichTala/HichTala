## Projects :computer:

- :art: Generating Logos using the DALL-E Model: This project involved creating a dataset using internet images and descriptions, then fine-tuning the DALL-E model on this dataset. (Python, PyTorch)
[Link to project](https://github.com/HichTala/diffusion-model-for-logo-generation)

- :card_index: Card Detection and Recognition Algorithm: Developed an algorithm for detecting and recognizing collectible and playing cards, proposed for a 3D modeling project. This involved creating a dataset and fine-tuning a state-of-the-art model. (Python, PyTorch)
[Link to project for detection](https://github.com/HichTala/mmdetection_yugioh)
[Link to project for classification](https://github.com/HichTala/yugioh-card-classification)

- :video_game: Determining Key Factors for Winning in League of Legends: Used machine learning to determine the most important factors for winning in the popular video game League of Legends. This "artificial intelligence" can be used by professional players during their training to focus on the truly influential factors. (Python, pandas, scikit learn) - 2022
