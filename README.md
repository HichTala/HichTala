- ðŸŽ® Determining Key Factors for Winning in League of Legends: Used machine learning to determine the most important factors for winning in the popular video game League of Legends. This "artificial intelligence" can be used by professional players during their training to focus on the truly influential factors. (Python, pandas, scikit learn) - 2022
